Xanthos Papanikolaou received his diploma from the School of Rural, Surveying 
& Geoinformatics Engineering, of the National Technical University of Athens 
in 2009. Since then, he has been working as an external researcher / research 
ascossiate, involved mainly in Satellite Geodesy, Precise Orbit Determination
and GPS/GNSS data acquisition, management and processing, collaborating with 
various institutions such as the National Technical University of Athens, the 
Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing 
and the Geodynamic Institute of the National Observatory of Athens. 

He is also a PhD candidate in the School of Rural, Surveying & Geoinformatics 
Engineering, of the National Technical University of Athens, currently fulfilling 
his thesis entitled "Methodology for orbit determination using DORIS RINEX data".

His area of expertise is Satellite Geodesy and Navigation and his research 
interests include big data management and acquisition, Global Navigation 
Satellite Ssystems (GNSS) data processing, Doppler Orbitography and 
Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) analysis, Orbit Determination, 
time-series analysis and computational mathematics. He has provided teaching 
assistance in the fields of Satellite Geodesy and Theory of Errors and 
Adjustment (int NTUA) and has a strong programming background and solid 
knowledge of English and German.

He has contributed in a number of studies, including the following:
